## üíª Versions Supported
Minecraft versions currently supported: **1.16, 1.14, 1.15**.


## üì• Installation
Download the .exe installer from github under releases: [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/pistacium/meeras_reset-inator_3000/releases/tag/v2.1)


## üß± Building

### Compiling

This is written in python, which not everyone has, so we use pyinstaller to make it into an exe file.

#### Requirements:
Listed in requirements.txt. To install them all, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a terminal.


If you want to make it yourself, run `pyinstaller meeras_reset-inator_3000.py --icon=kitty.ico --onefile` in a terminal.

### Setup File

The first setup was created with [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/), but the newer one is created with [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

## ‚å® Usage

The Macro Delay is measured in milliseconds, and a number must be in it for the program to work.
The default is set to 70, as this should in most cases show a frame of each world generation screen,
which is recommended for ease of verification. (delete old worlds if it's getting laggy, this can 
mess up the whole "70 should be fine" thing).

Once you've chosen settings, click "Solidify Settings" to save your settings.
If you want to change settings before running the macro, do so and hit "Solidify Settings" again.


After you are done, click "Run Macro" and the GUI will close, but the application will still be functioning.

RunMacro (default ctrl+m) starts the macro (be sure you're on your title screen of Minecraft when you do this, and that
the Minecraft window is in focus).

RestartGUI (default ctrl+l) restarts the program. You can do this at the end of runs and leave the program, or if you'd 
like to change settings at any time.

Perch (default ctrl+j) opens to LAN and sends a command to make the dragon perch. Run this macro
from the pause menu (not sure why but when I tried to make it run esc from within minecraft to make it pause
for you, it would hit the windows key. It makes no sense, maybe its just my computer idk lmao)


This program is designed to work with world files already existent, at the very least one. 
I recommend [Emma's End Practice Map](https://sites.google.com/view/emma-practice-map/home) [if you don't have it already, go get it. right now. im serious
go right now. not sponsored btw].
