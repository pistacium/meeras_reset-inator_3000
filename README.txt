meera's reset-inator 3000 VERSION 1.0
-------------------------------------------------------
Minecraft versions currently supported: 1.16
Application is in "dist\meeras reset-inator 3000\meeras reset-inator 3000.exe"
I recommend right clicking on it and sending to desktop, or wherever, for ease of access.
For keeping your computer neat, I also recommend putting it in some 
program files instead of Downloads or wherever you have it right now.

The Macro Delay is measured in milliseconds, and a number must be in it for the program to work.
The default is set to 70, as this should in most cases show a frame of each world generation screen,
which is recommended for ease of verification. (delete old worlds if it's getting laggy, this can 
mess up the whole "70 should be fine" thing).

Once you've chosen settings, click "Solidify Settings", and the button will remain pressed down as it applies
the settings, this is normal. For me it takes ~10 seconds, but can take longer depending on hardware (hopefully ill be fixing this in a future update).
If you want to change settings, do so and hit "Solidify Settings" again.


After you are done, click "Run Macro" and the GUI will close, but the application will still be functioning.

CTRL+M starts the macro (be sure you're on your title screen of Minecraft when you do this, and that
the Minecraft window is in focus).
CTRL+L restarts the program. You can do this at the end of runs and leave the program, or if you'd 
like to change settings at any time.

This program is designed to work with world files already existent, at the very least one. 
I recommend Emma's End Practice Map [if you don't have it already, go get it. right now. im serious
go right now, its in javacord somewhere. not sponsored btw].

If any issues arise, message me on discord meera#6969, or on twitter @pistaacium.
